# ConceptNet-Explorer
This project is a single-page web application that allows users to explore the ConceptNet knowledge graph, play interactive games with ConceptNet concepts, and update a MySQL database with new concepts and relationships. The app uses Sammy.js for client-side routing and AJAX to interact with the ConceptNet API.
